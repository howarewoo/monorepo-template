## Why This Template?

Starting a multi-platform project usually means stitching together separate repos, duplicating types, and fighting config drift. This template solves that:

- **One repo, three platforms** — Web, mobile, and API share code from day one with no copy-paste
- **Type safety everywhere** — oRPC contracts generate typed clients so API changes break at compile time, not in production
- **Production-ready CI** — GitHub Actions, Biome linting, Vitest tests, and Playwright E2E wired up out of the box
- **Modern defaults** — React 19, Next.js 16, Expo SDK 54, Tailwind v4, and Turborepo with zero legacy baggage

## Features

- **Shared by default** — Design tokens, navigation, UI components, and utilities live in shared packages consumed by every app
- **Type-safe end to end** — oRPC contracts generate typed clients; mismatches caught at compile time
- **Cross-platform** — Next.js 16 web + Expo SDK 54 mobile + Hono API, all in one repo
- **Modern tooling** — React 19, React Compiler, Tailwind v4, Turborepo, Biome, pnpm
- **Production CI/CD** — GitHub Actions for linting, testing, and database migrations on every PR

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology | Role |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Frontend (Web)** | Next.js 16, React 19, React Compiler | App Router with automatic memoization |
| **Frontend (Mobile)** | Expo SDK 54, React Native 0.81, Expo Router | iOS, Android, and mobile web with file-based routing |
| **API** | Hono, oRPC | Lightweight server with end-to-end typed RPC |
| **Styling** | Tailwind v4, shadcn/ui, UniWind | CSS-first config; shared design tokens across platforms |
| **Language** | TypeScript | Strict types everywhere, no `any` |
| **Monorepo** | Turborepo, pnpm | Cached builds, workspace dependency catalog |
| **Quality** | Biome, Vitest, Playwright | Lint + format, unit tests, E2E tests |

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js 22** — [download](https://nodejs.org/) or use a version manager like `fnm` / `nvm`
- **pnpm 10.29.3** — install via `corepack enable && corepack prepare pnpm@10.29.3 --activate`

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/howarewoo/monorepo-template.git
cd monorepo-template
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

| App | Port |
| --- | --- |
| Web | [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) |
| API | [localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) |
| Landing | [localhost:3002](http://localhost:3002) |
| Mobile | [localhost:8081](http://localhost:8081) |

## Architecture

```
monorepo-template/
├── apps/
│   ├── web/           Next.js 16 — App Router, React Compiler, shadcn/ui
│   ├── landing/       Next.js 16 — Marketing page
│   ├── mobile/        Expo SDK 54 — iOS, Android, Web
│   └── api/           Hono + oRPC — Type-safe API server
├── packages/
│   ├── features/      Business logic (scaffold)
│   └── infrastructure/
│       ├── api-client        oRPC contracts, router, typed client

│       ├── utils             Cross-platform helpers

```

Three-tier dependency flow:

```
  Apps  →  Features  →  Infrastructure
  (web, mobile, api)    (business logic)    (shared utilities)
```

- **Infrastructure** — shared utilities, used by everything
- **Features** — standalone business logic, imports only infrastructure
- **Apps** — compose infrastructure + features into deployable units

## Scripts

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `pnpm dev` | Start all apps in development |
| `pnpm build` | Build all packages via Turborepo |
| `pnpm test` | Run Vitest tests |
| `pnpm test:changed` | Test only packages changed since last commit |
| `pnpm test:e2e` | Run Playwright E2E tests |
| `pnpm typecheck` | Type check all packages |
| `pnpm lint` | Lint with Biome |
| `pnpm format` | Format with Biome |
| `pnpm clean` | Remove build artifacts and node_modules |
| `pnpm --filter <app> dev` | Run a single app (e.g. `pnpm --filter web dev`) |

## Key Patterns

**Type-safe API** — define a contract, get a typed client everywhere:

```typescript
// Define once
const contract = oc.router({
  users: { list: oc.route({ method: "GET" }).output(z.array(UserSchema)) },
});

// Use anywhere
const { data } = useQuery(orpc.users.list.queryOptions());
```

**Cross-platform navigation** — works on web (Next.js) and mobile (Expo) identically:

```typescript
import { Link, useNavigation } from "@infrastructure/navigation";
```

**Shared components** — shadcn/ui components shared across web apps:

```typescript
import { Button, Card } from "@infrastructure/ui-web";
```

**Dependency catalog** — single source of truth for shared versions:

```yaml
# pnpm-workspace.yaml
catalog:
  react: "19.1.0"
  next: "^16.0.0"
```

## AI-First Documentation

This repo uses documentation that serves as executable context for AI coding agents, so the AI follows the same rules as human contributors.

| File | Purpose | When to update |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `eng-constitution.md` | Binding engineering principles — architecture, code style, TDD, API stability. The AI agent treats these as non-negotiable rules. | When adding new architectural decisions or changing existing principles |
| `.claude/CLAUDE.md` | Operational instructions for Claude Code — commands, gotchas, key patterns, conventions. Loaded into every AI session. | When discovering new gotchas, adding packages, or changing workflows |
| `.claude/skills/*` | Automated workflows (PR review, commit, worktree). Define multi-step procedures the AI executes. | When adding or modifying automated development workflows |
| `.claude/commands/*` | Slash commands that invoke skills (e.g., `/commit`, `/pr-review`). | When exposing new skills as user-invocable commands |

The constitution sets the rules, CLAUDE.md provides operational details, and skills automate recurring tasks. When the AI agent works on this codebase, it reads these files and follows them as constraints — enforcing TDD, import boundaries, naming conventions, etc. without being told each time.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Whether it's a bug fix, new feature, or documentation improvement — we'd love your help.

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for setup and workflow. Architectural decisions are documented in the [engineering constitution](eng-constitution.md).
