# PR Review Skill

This skill provides comprehensive pull request analysis with deep semantic understanding of code changes using **parallel specialized auditors**.

## Capabilities

1. **Parallel Sub-Agent Architecture** - 5 specialized auditors run concurrently for faster, deeper analysis:
   - Security Auditor - Injection vulnerabilities, auth gaps, data exposure, race conditions
   - Architecture Auditor - Import boundaries, monorepo structure, file organization, naming
   - Constitution Auditor - All 14 project principles compliance verification
   - Code Quality Auditor - Complexity, code smells, performance, testing gaps
   - API Stability Auditor - oRPC compliance (Principle IX), breaking changes (Principle XIII)
2. **Smart Aggregation** - Findings merged, deduplicated, and sorted by severity
3. **PR Metadata Updates** - Automatically updates PR title and description (never just recommends)
4. **Logic Flow Visualization** - Mermaid diagrams for complex workflows
5. **Local Mode** - Create task list for local fixes instead of posting to GitHub
6. **Loop Mode** - Iterative review-fix-review cycle until clean or max iterations

## Usage Modes

### Standard Mode (default)
Posts review directly to GitHub PR:
- `/pr-review` or `/pr-review 123`

### Local Mode (`--local`)
Creates a task list of issues to fix locally without posting to GitHub:
- `/pr-review --local` or `/pr-review 123 --local`

Use local mode when you want to:
- Fix issues before requesting a formal review
- Self-review changes before pushing
- Iterate on fixes without cluttering PR comments

### Loop Mode (`--loop`)
Iteratively reviews, auto-fixes all findings, and re-reviews until 0 findings or max 5 iterations:
- `/pr-review --loop` or `/pr-review 123 --loop`

Use loop mode when you want to:
- Auto-fix all review findings without manual intervention
- Iterate until the PR is clean before posting to GitHub
- Get a fully automated review-fix-review cycle

On approval (0 findings), the review is automatically posted to GitHub.
On max iterations or stall, a local task list of remaining findings is created.

**Note:** `--loop` and `--local` are mutually exclusive. If both are passed, the skill errors out.

## Quick Start

When a pull request needs review, ask Claude to:
- "Review this pull request"
- "Analyze the changes in this PR"
- "Check if these changes follow our constitution"
- "Review this PR locally" (uses `--local` mode)

Claude will automatically use this skill to perform comprehensive analysis.

## Autonomous Execution

This skill runs **fully autonomously** without user interaction. When invoked:

- **Do NOT ask for user confirmation** at any step
- **Do NOT pause** between tasks or wait for approval
- **Proceed directly** through all workflow tasks
- **Only stop** if a critical error occurs (gh CLI not authenticated, invalid PR number, or API failure)

Execute the entire workflow from start to finish:
- **Standard mode**: Posts review to GitHub automatically
- **Local mode**: Creates task list for local fixes (no GitHub posting)
- **Loop mode**: Iteratively reviews and fixes until clean, then posts to GitHub

## Operating Constraints

- **GitHub CLI Required**: Must have `gh` authenticated and be in a git repository
- **Parallel Execution**: Uses Task tool to launch 5 specialized auditors concurrently
- **AI-Driven Analysis**: All findings generated through semantic analysis
- **Constitution Knowledge**: Understands all 14 project principles (v1.0.0)
- **Completion Criteria**: See [WORKFLOW.md](WORKFLOW.md) Tasks 7 and 8 for success criteria

## Specialized Auditors

| Auditor | Focus Area | Key Checks |
|---------|------------|------------|
| **Security** | Vulnerabilities | Injection, XSS, auth gaps, data exposure, race conditions |
| **Architecture** | Structure | Import boundaries, file organization, naming conventions |
| **Constitution** | 14 Principles | Full compliance with all project principles |
| **Code Quality** | Maintainability | Complexity, code smells, performance, testing |
| **API Stability** | oRPC/APIs | Principle IX & XIII, breaking changes |

Each auditor runs independently via the Task tool and returns findings in a structured format for aggregation.

## Workflow

For the detailed workflow with parallel auditors, see [WORKFLOW.md](WORKFLOW.md).

## Analysis Guide

For analysis criteria, finding formats, and templates, see [ANALYSIS_GUIDE.md](ANALYSIS_GUIDE.md).

## Output

The skill **directly updates** the PR (not just recommends):
1. **PR Title** - Updated via `gh pr edit --title` with conventional commit format
2. **PR Description** - Updated via `gh pr edit --body` with structured markdown
3. **Review Comment** - Posted via `gh pr comment` with categorized findings
